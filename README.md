Currently there are numerous issues with Eclipse and JavaFX requiring VM arguments to run, which in turn doesn't allow for compilation of executable JARs to be made. 
Then there are issues with macOS Big Sur and Netbeans, making it impossible to use Netbeans to build an executable JAR as well. So for now the only way to use this yourself
is by running the code in your own IDE and compiling it yourself.
